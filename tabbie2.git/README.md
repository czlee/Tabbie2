Tabbie2 - Source Code
===================================

This is a Yii 2 php application (http://www.yiiframework.com) with multiple tiers.
The structure is:
```
- frontend     What the user sees and uses
- backend      What the tabbie admin uses and makes analysis and entering variables
- console      What the webserver uses to execute cronjobs
- api          What an app, react frontend or external service might use to make REST API calls
```
each of which
is a separate Yii application.

The template is designed to work in a team development environment. It supports
deploying the application in different environments.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by this application template that your Web server supports PHP 5.4.0, and the following extensions:
 - mbstring
 - xml
 - mcrypt

GETTING STARTED
---------------

After you install the application, you have to conduct the following steps to initialize
the installed application. You only need to do these once for all.

1. Install composer (https://getcomposer.org)
2. Open terminal and go to the /tabbie2.git folder.
3. run `composer global require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin:~1.0.0"`
4. run `composer update` to load the vendor directory - this will take some time
5. Run command `php init` to initialize the application with a specific environment.
6. Create a new database and adjust the configuration in `common/config/main-local.php` accordingly.
7. Apply migrations with console command `yii migrate`. This will create tables needed for the application to work.

To login into the application, you need to first sign up, with any of your email address, username and password.
Then, you can login into the application with same email address and password at any time.
